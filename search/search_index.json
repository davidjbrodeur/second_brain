Repository of knowledge, links and sources on specific subjects It helps me understand things in my own words It triggers the \"active learning\" part of any good learning Why share it publicly? It might be useful as a source of information Someone else might think/understand like me, meaning this is a great learning tool for them Some people might comment on the content, forcing me to readjust my knowledge What's in scope?

Things will change. Last change will be amended with dates. The second brain will follow the \"atomicity rule\": one concept per note; deep links, no copy-paste duplication. Everything is my own and if any bias exists, I'll note them; if I think something is best practice, I'll mention where I took it from and why I think it's best practice based on personal experience. Content Map (wip) How it this made? I create notes with Obsidian. Then I run a script to use mkdocs and send it over on Github as a Github page.
