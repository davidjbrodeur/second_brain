It has the following characteristics: - Local data : It doesn't keep things on the cloud, it's all local (although there are options to unlock cross-device, or use something like github) - Wikistyle : You can use a bunch of wiki-style features, including a very useful visual graph view. - Community : You can get a bunch of free plugins both from the team and the community to help cater to your style. - Simple markdown : Nothing fancy, it's all .md on your device. As a side note, I also find it useful for other projects, such as tabletop role-playing campaign tracking.
